      <h2>Collected with intention</h2>

      <p>
        Hi, I’m Rebecca — a lifelong collector, cat mom, creative spirit, and lover of quiet beauty.
      </p>

      <p>
        I recently moved to St. Catharines and fell instantly in love with the Niagara region — the water,
        the stone, the history, the energy. Exploring beaches, trails, and forgotten places has become
        part of my everyday inspiration.
      </p>

      <p>
        My world is shaped by small details: a perfectly worn stone, a soft color palette, natural
        textures, and moments that feel grounding. I believe beauty doesn’t need to be loud — it just
        needs to be intentional.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I’m not collecting or creating, I’m usually surrounded by my five cats — Olive, Puzzle,
        Finn, Nala, and Smokey — who constantly remind me to slow down and notice the little things.
        I also carry the memory of Caesar with me always.
      </p>

      <p>
        This space is a reflection of what I love: curated finds, quiet luxury, soft color, and a life
        built gently and with care.
      </p>
